name: distill
description: Shape a request into an implementation-ready IP and task list with minimal back-and-forth, like terreno Grow but with triage instead of grilling. Asks only questions fundamental to the feature, records every other question with its recommendation at the bottom of the IP, parks expansions for later, attacks the draft with `cut`, fixes it, then sends the IP for async sign-off over Slack, text, or email. Use when asked to distill, plan, or spec a feature for later execution by `barrel`; not for implementation.

# Distill — shape with little grilling

Turn a request, ticket, or spec into an IP a fresh `barrel` run can execute without the
conversation. Terreno Grow grills every human decision before writing. Distill asks only
the questions a wrong guess would ruin, writes the plan on its recommendations, and puts
everything else in front of the human once, at sign-off.

Read before acting:

- [`distilling`](references/distilling.md): triage, IP bottom sections, sign-off brief
- [`lifecycle contract`](../terreno-shared/lifecycle-contract.md) (stage results and execution state)
- [`documentation contract`](../terreno-shared/documentation-contract.md)
- [`reaching the human`](../terreno-shared/reaching-the-human.md)

## Run it with brewery

`brewery distill "<request>"` runs this as separate agent processes (Claude, Codex, or local models via
litellm). brewery runs cut in a clean worktree, owns the `Status:` line, and
collects the sign-off reply with `brewery answer <slug> "ok"`. Source: `tools/brewery/`. Use this skill directly for an
interactive, single-session run.

## Inputs

- Request, ticket, or spec and linked context, verbatim
- Existing IP and task files when revising
- Repository instructions, architecture docs, code, tests, history, project skills
- Execution state and any "Prior human answers" preamble (from zerg or a pasted reply)

## Procedure

1. **Reconstruct.** Use the repository's IP convention. Otherwise use
   `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, with the task list in the same file, and state at
   `.terreno/pipeline/<slug>.json`. If an IP already says `awaiting sign-off` and a reply
   has arrived, jump to step 11.
2. **Read architecture docs** for the affected area. The IP must resolve docs that are
   missing or contradict the code.
3. **Discover supporting skills** relevant to the affected files and record them.
4. **Research.** Answer every discoverable fact yourself, with explore subagents in
   parallel. Never ask the human something the repo, docs, or git history can answer.
5. **Triage** every open question per [`distilling`](references/distilling.md):
   fundamental, deferrable, expansion, or implementation detail.
6. **Ask only fundamental questions.** One round, at most four, each with a recommended
   option. When the human is in the chat, use the structured question tool and wait.
   When the human is not in the chat, do not block: write the IP on your
   recommendation, mark the question fundamental, and it goes first in the sign-off.
   With no fundamental questions, skip straight to writing.
7. **Shape.** Contracts, models, and APIs before implementation detail. Scope, non-scope,
   architecture decisions, risks, rollout, dependencies.
8. **Specify proof.** Every acceptance criterion is observable and names its verification
   method. "Manual check" is not one.
9. **Write** the IP: the brief on top, then the dependency-ordered tracer-bullet task
   list (files or seams, criteria, blockers, verification, docs, supporting skills), then
   the bottom sections from [`distilling`](references/distilling.md): Open questions,
   Expansions, Decisions, Sign-off. Build the plan on the recommendations. Set
   `Status: draft`.
10. **Cut, then fix.** Invoke the `cut` skill with the IP path and the user-context packet
    it describes. Cut only reports findings. For each one, pick the fix:
    - edit the IP and task list so it holds;
    - move it to Open questions with a recommendation, when it is a human decision;
    - move it to Expansions, when it is new scope;
    - rebut it in one line with evidence (a file, a quote from the human), when the
      attack is wrong.

    Blocking findings must all be edited, moved, or rebutted. When any blocking finding
    changed the plan, run `cut` once more on the new draft. Stop after two cut rounds and
    carry anything left into Open questions. Record the tally in the Sign-off section.
11. **Sign off.** Set `Status: awaiting sign-off` and send the sign-off message per
    [`reaching the human`](../terreno-shared/reaching-the-human.md): fundamental questions
    first, then the open questions whose answers would change the most, with a link to
    the IP for the rest. Emit `BLOCKED` (`stage: grow`, `next: null`,
    `block: [{kind: human}]`, one `ask` per question in the message) and stop.
12. **Apply the reply.** When answers arrive, move each answered question from Open
    questions to Decisions. Where an answer differs from the recommendation, rewrite the
    affected tasks and criteria, and run `cut` once more if the change is structural.
    A reply that rejects the plan returns to step 5 with the reason. When the human has
    approved, set `Status: approved <date>`, update execution state, and emit `PASS`
    with `next: pick`. The next step is `barrel`.

Do not set `approved` without an explicit approval from the human. Remaining Open
questions are fine at approval: `barrel` builds on their recommendations.

## Success

- A reviewer with only the sign-off message and the IP can approve or push back.
- A fresh `barrel` run can find the next task, its criteria, decisions, assumptions, and
  skills in the IP alone.
- Every question the human did not answer is visible at the bottom of the IP with the
  recommendation the plan assumed.

## Failure and blocked

- Malformed or contradictory artifacts: `FAIL`, `next: grow`, exact defects.
- Waiting on sign-off or a fundamental answer: `BLOCKED`, `next: null`, with asks.
- Missing access or evidence that research cannot recover: `BLOCKED` with the exact action.
